# Landing Page
## My first project in FWD scholarship.
It's landing page with 4 sections and navigation bar.
active state was added to navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
Styling has been added for active states.
There is a  top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below
